1. In the example above, let's say there's a Manager named Steve. The class would be Manager,
and when the object Steve is created, that class is being instantiated.

2. There could be a main module that each individual module draws from, but each individual module
has specifications that are necessary for their scenarios.
For example, there can be a main Manager salary class that all everybody draws from, but if two branches of the company are in different states
with different costs of living and average regional salaries, their individual modules can adjust for that

Another example would be an overseas branch of the country with salary modules that draw from the main module but adjust for currency.

3. It allows you to write less code if you use a library instead of writing entire functions.

6. To access private variables.

9. 102, 2, 1300

13. There needs to be a function in SalesPerson that counts the amount of sales that
Salesperson has done (through salesHistory) and then runs the calculation.

14. Polymorphism would allow this program to be used with different GUI's as explained
in problem 2.
